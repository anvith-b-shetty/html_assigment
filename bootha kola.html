        <h1> Bootha kola is one of the most known rituals from Udupi 
because of the film Kantara. This just translates to 'spirit play' 
where the devotees call upon the spirit of God into a specific 
trained person who is believed to have temporarily become a 
god himself.</h1>

         <h1>The performer displays an aggressive outlook, dances 
fiercely, and performs multiple rituals after which the spirit is 
pleased by giving food mostly fermented toddy, and raw meat 
of a live rooster in case of few spirits.</h1>

          <h1>Even during some maha puja or festival, the spirit of God 
is called to possess the body of the performer during which 
devotees ask for solutions for the problems they are facing 
during the period of possession. </h1>
